Example Usage:
--------------
To generate a CSV file for a circular trajectory, use the following code snippet:

create_active_csv(shape_name="circle", diameter=5.0, direction=1, maneuver_time=60.0, start_x=0.0, start_y=0.0, initial_altitude=10.0, climb_rate=2.0, move_speed=2.5, hold_time=2.0)

Visualization:
--------------
After generating the CSV file, you can visualize the trajectory using plot functions and save the trajectory plot in the "shaped" folder along with the CSV file.

Note:
-----
Make sure to have the necessary dependencies installed and correctly set up the offboard control system to use the generated CSV file for controlling the drone in an offboard mode.

Usage:
------
The output generated by `csvCreator.py` can be utilized in the `offboard_from_csv.py` file, also available in the same GitHub repository, to control a drone in an offboard mode. The generated CSV file contains the necessary information for each step of the drone's trajectory, including position, velocity, acceleration, yaw angle, and LED colors.

Offboard Control in PX4:
------------------------
The offboard mode in PX4 is a flight mode that allows external systems to control the drone's position and velocity directly. It enables autonomous flight and is commonly used in research, development, and testing scenarios. The offboard control system communicates with the drone's flight controller through a communication protocol like MAVLink.

To use the CSV output generated by `csvCreator.py` for offboard control in PX4, you can follow these steps:
1. Load the generated CSV file, which represents the desired trajectory for the drone.
2. Extract the position and velocity information from the CSV file.
3. Send the position and velocity commands to the drone's flight controller using an offboard control system, such as the `offboard_from_csv.py` script.
4. The flight controller will interpret the commands and execute the desired trajectory, guiding the drone accordingly.
